# Starting in the top left corner of a 2Ã—2 grid, and only being able to move to

# It turns out that the number of lattice paths for a grid of size n can be
# found in the (2 * n)th row and the nth column of Pascal's Triangle.
#
# The number at row n and column k of the triangle is given by the polynomial
# coefficient nCk ("n choose k").
